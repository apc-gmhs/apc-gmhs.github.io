⚠️⚠️⚠️ IMPORTANT UPDATE ALERT - READ ⚠️⚠️⚠️
<br>
<br>
Hi APC - please remember that **next Friday at 11:00am** (11/20/20) is when Mr. Timothy Lee will be coming and speaking to us. We **highly encourage** you to come to this meeting — as we said before, Mr. Lee is taking time out of his day to come speak to us so we’d really like to give him a decent turnout. Please use the poll below to indicate whether you plan on attending (saying yes > saying no > not replying at all). There will not be a meeting today, but as always the compendium is linked below.
<br>
Thank you all,
<br>
Rohan Suri
