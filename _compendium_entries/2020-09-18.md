Hey there guys, its your main man Mr. Andrew Lester and I'm excited
to bring you the first edition of APC's nationally syndicated
**RESOURCE COMPENDIUM** (make bold). Today we've put
together a few articles about what this wacky thing we call
"""computer science""" actually is, what coding means and a fun
little test about how you've interacted with FCCPS' information
technology. This compendium entry is on schoology, but future ones
will be on the official APC Website. Reminder our first meeting is
next Friday (9/25/20) at 11am. If you don't show up I will be
incredibly disappointed, and perhaps even saddened.
